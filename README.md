# Dropdown Using DOM Manipulation

You'll see the dropdowns and the styledDiv <div> element with the specified properties. As you select different options from the dropdowns, 
The properties of the styledDiv <div> will change accordingly through DOM manipulation.

In DOM we are using a document.getElementById() then we get all the values and addEventListener() and operation change used for the changing value.

The same thing applies to all dropdown elements.
